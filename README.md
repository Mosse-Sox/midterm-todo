This is our Midterm Project for Lighthouse Labs. This app is a smart todo list that leverages OpenAI to categorize todos for users. Something we really tried to keep in mind while building this was the users experience across all devices, os, and browsers. The way users perform CRUD actions is based around ease for the user. You simply type in your todo, it get categorized for you, if you don't like the order or you meant the book version of harry potter vs the movie you can drag the item to the correct list or move them into the correct order. Marking a task complete moves it off your pending list into a completed task list, for those who like to track their progress. If its getting too cluttered, you can delete any items you want by pressing the x button on the righthand side of the todo box.

## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
  - username: `labber` 
  - password: `labber` 
  - database: `midterm`
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
7. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`.
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`.
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples. 
- Use helper functions to run your SQL queries and clean up any data coming back from the database. See `db/queries` for pre-populated examples.
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.
